This project is an attempt at implementing a deep ocean simulation with dynamic optimal meshing and realistic wave models, 
as decribed in [HISSINGER et al, 2002. Interactive Animation of Ocean Waves.](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00537490/document). We used the VCL enviroment (and [library](https://bitbucket.org/mbredif/vcl/src/master/)) to develop this project.
